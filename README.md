# Yolov8 Object detection counting and tracking using ByteTrack
Object Detection, Counting and Tracking Using YoloV8 with Supervision ByteTrack and LineZone Counter.


This Project is based on Roboflow Tutorial ('Tutorial')[https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-track-and-count-vehicles-with-yolov8.ipynb] which used supervision==0.1.0.

I have modified the code according to supervision==0.13.0. The ByteTrack is integrated in this version of supervision, and its much more easier to build your object detection, counting and tracking project than before.
